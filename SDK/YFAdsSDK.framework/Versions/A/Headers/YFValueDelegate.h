/*!
 @brief YFValueDelegate is not intended to be used directly. It is used for type safety.
 @discussion LOTValueDelegates are used to dynamically change animation data at runtime. A delegate is set for a keypath, defined by YFKeypath. While the animation is running the delegate is asked for the value for the keypath at each frame of the animation. The delegate is given the computed animation value for the the current frame. See YFKeypath and the setValueDelegate:forKeypath method on YFAnimationView.

 Prebuild delegates can be found in LOTBlockCallback, LOTInterpolatorCallback, and LOTValueCallback. These delegates allow direct setting and driving of an animated value.
 See LOTColorValueDelegate, LOTNumberValueDelegate, LOTPointValueDelegate, LOTSizeValueDelegate, LOTPathValueDelegate.
